# Personal dwm configuration

My dwm configuration uses the following patches:

- fibonnaci
- focusonclick
- statusallmons
- swallow
- vanitygaps

I have also set some custom keybinds to control audio levels and start up some
applications.  
The code should be self-explanatory.

May throw dependency errors on compilation. Just install the needed packages if it happens.
